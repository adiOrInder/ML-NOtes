it is like $r^2$ for finding relation between two variables 

$$
M I = \sum^x \sum^y  P(x,y)\log_{e}\left( \frac{P(x,y)}{P(x)P(y)} \right)
$$
where P(x,y) is joint probability
and P(a) is Marginal probability
this is for non continuous discrete variable set

But for discrete continous variable we make a histogram then categorize
them and then predict


idea for fitting a line to data 

the line which has the least RSS 

$$
RSS = (y-y_{1}^2)+(y-y_{2}^2)\dots\dots(y-y_{n}^2)
$$
where y is the for fitting line used
y = mx+c
we can substitute that
