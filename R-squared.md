R^2 is a measure that represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(TSS) in a regression model
(Technically variance around the mean line - variance around linear eq. divided by variance around the mean line)
$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{RSS}{TSS}
$$
RSS - residual sum of Squares
TSS - total sum of squares(compared)
